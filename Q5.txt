Text editors and integrated development environments (IDEs) are both used to write and edit code. Text editors 
are simpler and better for quick edits, while IDEs are more feature-rich and better for larger projects. 
Features 
---------
Text editors Provide basic features like syntax highlighting and file management. They can be good for quick 
edits and smaller projects.
IDEs Provide more comprehensive features like debugging tools, project management, and automated refactoring.
 They can be more efficient for larger projects.

Development experience 
-----------------------
Text editors: Can only write code.
IDEs: Provide a more complete experience, including:
a) Previewing code as you type
b) Running programs from within the IDE
c) Writing plugins
d) Compiling and debugging code

Hardware requirements
---------------------
Text editors: Require fewer hardware resources like memory, disk space, and processing power.
IDEs: Require more memory, space, and fast processing.
